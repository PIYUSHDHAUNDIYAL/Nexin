# NEXIN – AI-Powered Smart E-Commerce Platform

A serverless, production-ready e-commerce platform with an AI-based recommendation system.

##  Project Overview

NEXIN is a modern smart shopping platform that uses machine learning to recommend products based on user behavior and product similarity.
The system is designed using a serverless architecture to ensure scalability, performance, and cost efficiency.
This project demonstrates full-stack development, ML integration, and cloud deployment best practices.

##  Tech Stack
Frontend
 React + Vite + TypeScript
 Tailwind CSS
 Deployed on Vercel
 Backend / Database
 Supabase (PostgreSQL)

REST API with Row Level Security (RLS)
Machine Learning Service
 Python (Flask)
scikit-learn
TF-IDF Vectorization + Cosine Similarity
Deployed on Render

## AI Recommendation System

The recommendation engine is content-based and works as follows:
Combines product name, brand, category, and description
Converts text into vectors using TF-IDF
Calculates similarity using Cosine Similarity

Applies:
Category-first filtering
Price range similarity
Brand affinity boost
Returns top-N recommended products
ML API Endpoints
GET / → Service status
GET /health → Health check
POST /recommend → Product recommendations
POST /reload → Rebuild ML model (secure)

## Features
## E-Commerce

Product listing & product details
Add to cart & cart drawer
Wishlist (persistent using localStorage)
Recently viewed products

## AI-Powered

Product-based recommendations
Explainable recommendations (brand, category, price similarity)
Cached inference for performance

## UI/UX

Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
Skeleton loaders
Glassmorphism navbar
Animated cart drawer
Modern product cards

## Architecture

- Frontend (Vercel)
  - Supabase REST API
    - PostgreSQL Database
    - Row Level Security (RLS)
  - ML Recommendation API (Render)
    - TF-IDF Vectorizer
    - Cosine Similarity
    - In-memory caching

          
## Security & Best Practices

Environment variables for all secrets
Supabase RLS enabled
ML service uses service role key (server-side only)
CORS restricted to frontend domain
No hardcoded credentials

## Project Structure

frontend
- components
  - Navbar.tsx
  - ProductCard.tsx
  - CartDrawer.tsx
- pages
  - Home.tsx
  - Shop.tsx
  - ProductDetails.tsx

## How It Works (Flow)

Products are stored in Supabase
Frontend fetches products using Supabase REST API
When a product is viewed:

1-View is tracked
2-Product ID is sent to ML service
3-ML service returns recommended product IDs
4-Frontend displays recommendations with UI explainability
